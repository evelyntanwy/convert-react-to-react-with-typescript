# Convert React to React with Typescript
This repos is to support a demonstration of the process of converting a React App to a React App with Typescript.

There's an [article written by Thomas Guibert which covers the same ground as this demo](https://medium.com/swlh/convert-your-javascript-react-app-to-typescript-the-easy-guide-631592dc1876) ([repos](https://github.com/thmsgbrt/Javascript-to-TypeScript-guide)), however it dates from 2019 so it's a little dated. This repos is my attempt at a 2022 version.
