# Convert React to React with Typescript
This repos is to support a demonstration of the process of converting a React App to a React App with Typescript.

The intention is to take an app which is sufficiently simple that we can look at the entire process of conversion within the course of a single workshop. Inevitably the problem at hand is .... todos !

The application used as a demonstration uses only Functional Components so the issues associated with Stateful components are not covered in this demo.

## The process

The [README in the 'react_and_typescript directory'](react_and_typescript/README.md) provides a 'shopping list' of those tasks which are necessary to convert a React only application to one that uses Typescript. 

## Credit
There's an [article written by Thomas Guibert which covers the same ground as this demo](https://medium.com/swlh/convert-your-javascript-react-app-to-typescript-the-easy-guide-631592dc1876) ([repos](https://github.com/thmsgbrt/Javascript-to-TypeScript-guide)), however it dates from 2019 so it's a little dated. This repos is my attempt at a 2022 version.
